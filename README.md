# FilmAnalyst :movie_camera: :bar_chart:
FilmAnalyst is a tool made in Python to analyze a set of data. In this case it analyzes a list of films watched in a year.

Every year since 2019 I have taken the time to write down every film I watch including its title, year and director. All my lists look something like this:
```bash
- A Serious Man (2009) dir. Joel and Ethan Coen
- North by Northwest (1959) dir. Alfred Hitchcock
- Paths of Glory (1957) dir. Stanley Kubrick
- Come and See (1985) dir. Elem Kl√≠mov
- The Northman (2022) dir. Robert Eggers
```
I was curious to see more data regarding every film, like how popular each one is or what film is considered the best among the ones I watched.
So I decided to use web scraping to collect data from a familiar web-site called FilmAffinity (similar to iMDB but for spanish speaking people). 
I used the data I had (title, year, director) and combined it with the data I scraped that I was interested in to write an Excel document.
